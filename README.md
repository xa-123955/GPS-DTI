GPS-DTI: An interpretable geometric graph neural network for drugâ€“target interaction prediction

Overview
GPS-DTI is a deep learning model designed to predict Drug-Target Interactions (DTIs). The model integrates a GINE (Graph Isomorphism Network) graph neural network with a multi-head attention mechanism, aiming to enhance prediction accuracy and biological interpretability. It uses pre-trained protein embeddings from ESM-2 and includes a cross-attention module to capture both local and global features of drug molecules.

Model Architecture

Graph Neural Network (GINE): Used to extract drug and target features from molecular graphs, improving prediction accuracy by capturing the structure of the molecules.
Multi-head Attention Mechanism: Allows the model to focus on various parts of the graph representations, enhancing the ability to learn both local and global features.
Cross-Attention Module: Incorporates protein features via the ESM-2 pre-trained model, improving the biological interpretability of predictions.

Usage

To train the model on your own dataset, follow these steps:

1. Prepare Your Data
Make sure your dataset is in the correct format with two columns: drug and target, and corresponding interaction labels.

2. Train the Model
Run the following command to start the training process:

python train.py --train-data <path_to_train_data> --epochs 50 --batch-size 32 --learning-rate 1e-4

3. Evaluate the Model
After training, you can evaluate the model on a test dataset:

python evaluate.py --test-data <path_to_test_data> --model <path_to_trained_model>

Results
Results show that GPS-DTI outperforms existing models in terms of prediction accuracy, especially under cold-start conditions. The model is also capable of providing interpretable insights into drug-target interactions through the attention mechanism.
